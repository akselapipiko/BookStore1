# BookStore1
This is a simple and functional bookstore application built using C# in Visual Studio for the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.
Both the frontend and backend are part of the same repository, as the project uses Razor Pages â€” which tightly integrates the UI with server-side logic.
